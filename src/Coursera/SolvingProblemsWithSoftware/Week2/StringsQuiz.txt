Question 2
Consider the following mystery method.

1234567891011121314151617181920
public String mystery(String dna) {
  int pos = dna.indexOf("T");
  int count = 0;
  int startPos = 0;
  String newDna = "";
  if (pos == -1) {
    return dna;
  }
  while (count < 3) {
    count += 1;

Which of the following best describes what it does?


a.The method mystery is given a string and it returns a string which is the same string but with the each T each replaced with two T’s.


b.The method mystery is given a string and it returns a string which is three copies of the original string.


c.The method mystery is given a string and it returns a string which is the same string but with the first three T’s each replaced with two T’s.


d.The method mystery is given a string and it returns a string which is the same string but with all the T’s removed.


e.The method mystery is given a string and it returns a string which is the same string but with the first three T’s removed.
